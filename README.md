This project is made with angular 7, node.js and express with data saving in google firebase You have to check if node modules have been extracted or not, and if not extract it in both folders(i.e. backend and frontend)

when you do it go to visual studio compiler and open the whole folder of project through add workspace. when done, right-click backend and select open in terminal. write npm install (note that when done it changes powershell/zsh to node [this means succesful])

open frontend, and right click on crm-editor-form and select open in terminal. write npm install (same applies here as well check type of terminal)

next step is to go back to backend terminal and write node index.js

then go to frontend again and type npm run start

after successful compilation, search on search engine and type localhost it will open up the 1st form to select view of form. when submitted will open final form which will accept multiple entries and data will be stored in google database
